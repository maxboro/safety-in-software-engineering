# Standards and Certification Landscape

### Why standards exist and how to read them

**Why they exist**

* **Shared baseline for “due diligence.”** Safety standards encode commonly accepted engineering practices so teams don’t reinvent “what good looks like” for hazard analysis, requirements, verification, configuration management, and change control.
* **A bridge to regulators and auditors.** In many sectors, regulators publish rules, then recognize standards as an *acceptable means* to show compliance (aviation is a clear example). ([faa.gov][1])
* **Supply-chain contract language.** Even when not legally required, customers often demand compliance because it reduces integration and liability risk.

**How to read them efficiently (developer-oriented)**

1. **Start with Scope + Definitions.** This prevents misapplying the standard (e.g., some are limited to certain product categories or types of systems). ([iso.org][2])
2. **Identify what is mandatory vs guidance.**

   * Look for normative language (“**shall**” statements), and separate it from informative annexes/guidance.
3. **Find the “spine” of the lifecycle.** Most safety standards boil down to:

   * plan → hazard/risk analysis → requirements → design/implementation constraints → verification/validation → configuration/change control → operational feedback.
4. **Locate the rigor knobs (“integrity levels”).**

   * Many standards scale required rigor with a risk classification (examples: **ASIL** in automotive, **SIL** in IEC functional safety family). Higher levels typically mean more evidence, stricter verification, and more independence. ([assets.iec.ch][3])
5. **Treat cross-references as requirements.** If a clause says “do X according to Y,” you often need both, or an explicit rationale for an alternative.

### Examples of domain standards (high-level)

Below is a “map” of commonly encountered standards and what they’re broadly used for. (Not exhaustive; names vary by region and product.)

#### Automotive

* **ISO 26262 (Functional Safety, road vehicles):** lifecycle and work products for safety-related E/E systems in series-production road vehicles. ([iso.org][2])
* **ISO 21448 (SOTIF):** safety of the intended functionality—addresses hazards from functional insufficiencies (often relevant to complex sensors/algorithms, ADAS/automation). ([iso.org][4])

#### Medical devices

* **IEC 62304:** software lifecycle processes for medical device software; recognized in the FDA’s consensus standards database (important in practice for market access). ([FDA Access Data][5])
* **ISO 14971:** medical device risk management across the product lifecycle (hazards → risk controls → residual risk). ([iso.org][6])
* **ISO 13485:** quality management system requirements commonly used for medical device organizations. ([iso.org][7])

#### Industrial / machinery / process

* **IEC 61508:** “umbrella” functional safety standard for E/E/PE safety-related systems; basis for many sector standards and uses a risk-based approach and safety integrity levels. ([assets.iec.ch][3])
* **IEC 62061 (machinery):** requirements/recommendations for design, integration, and validation of safety-related control systems for machines, within the IEC 61508 framework. ([webstore.iec.ch][8])
* **ISO 13849-1 (machinery):** methodology and requirements/guidance for safety-related parts of control systems, including software aspects. ([iso.org][9])
* **IEC 61511 (process industry):** safety instrumented systems (SIS) for process sector, developed as an implementation of IEC 61508. ([webstore.iec.ch][10])

#### Aviation

* **DO-178C (airborne software):** industry “standard route” to show software assurance for airborne systems; regulators describe it as an acceptable means of compliance. ([faa.gov][1])
* **ARP4754A (systems development assurance):** guidance for development of civil aircraft and systems; recognized by FAA as an acceptable method for establishing a development assurance process. ([faa.gov][11])
* **DO-254 (airborne electronic hardware):** design assurance guidance for airborne electronic hardware (important when software depends on complex programmable logic/avionics hardware). ([faa.gov][12])

#### Rail

* **EN 50126-1:** RAMS (reliability, availability, maintainability, safety) and generic lifecycle aspects. ([iTeh Standards][13])
* **EN 50128:** process/technical requirements for software used in railway control and protection applications. ([iTeh Standards][14])
* **EN 50129:** applicable to safety-related electronic systems for railway signalling applications (functional safety focus). ([iTeh Standards][15])

### When you should care

You should assume standards matter (and ask early) when any of these triggers are true:

1. **You are building a regulated product** (or software is part of one).

   * Medical devices and aviation are typical examples where regulators and notified bodies expect recognizable process evidence. ([FDA Access Data][5])
2. **A customer requires compliance** (contractual flow-down).

   * Common for automotive/rail/industrial suppliers: even if *you* aren’t certifying the whole system, you may need to deliver compliant components and evidence packages.
3. **High-severity hazards exist** (credible paths to injury/death/major environmental or property damage).

   * Even outside “formal regulation,” teams often adopt a standard-derived process because it structures rigor: hazard analysis, traceability, verification depth, change control.
4. **You will claim safety properties publicly** (“safe”, “certifiable”, “SIL2-ready”, etc.).

   * Claims tend to pull in a need for auditable evidence, even if certification is not immediate.

Practical heuristic: if failure consequences are severe *or* your component is upstream of safety functions, treat standards as engineering constraints, not paperwork.

### Mapping to developer actions: what it means in daily engineering work

Standards vary by domain, but the day-to-day implications for software engineers usually cluster into the same work habits:

**1) Requirements become testable and traceable**

* Write safety-related requirements so they can be verified (clear conditions, bounds, failure responses).
* Maintain trace links: hazard/risk → safety requirement → design element → code → tests → results (and update links on change).

**2) You implement with explicit constraints**

* Make safety-relevant state machines explicit (modes, transitions, interlocks).
* Encode safety envelopes (limits, plausibility checks, timeouts) as first-class logic, not “best effort.”

**3) Verification is planned, deeper, and evidence-producing**

* More negative testing (fault injection, timeouts, corrupted inputs).
* Stronger independence where required (e.g., separate reviewer/test author, or separate verification role at higher rigor levels).
* Keep test logs/results as controlled artifacts, not ephemeral CI output.

**4) Configuration management is part of safety**

* Treat builds as reproducible: version pinning, toolchain tracking, artifact signing where needed.
* Control changes: impact analysis, review gates, and explicit re-verification triggers after modifications.

**5) Documentation is a deliverable**

* Many standards expect lifecycle work products (plans, requirements, design rationale, verification records, anomaly reports). For medical software, IEC 62304 explicitly frames lifecycle processes; for aviation, regulators describe compliance via recognized assurance means. ([FDA Access Data][5])

**6) “Integrity levels” translate into engineering rigor**
Across domains, higher risk class typically means:

* tighter process discipline (planning + reviews),
* stronger verification (coverage/robustness expectations),
* more evidence retention,
* and more independence in verification/QA. ([assets.iec.ch][3])

If you want one actionable takeaway for a small team: **adopt the lifecycle spine + traceability + evidence mindset early**, then scale rigor (reviews, testing depth, independence, documentation) with the credible worst-case hazards and customer/regulatory expectations.
